# About

## Bio
Born in Denver, CO. Lives in Detroit, MI. 

My art is shaped by years spent in the underground music and art scenes of Denver, Nashville and Detroit.

##Statement
I’m interested in where media and self, psychology and technology, body and screen, marketing and myth collapse in technological change. I work in the gap between futurists’ utopian marketing visions and our ambivalence towards technology. I make works haunted by both past and future to find new forms of presence.
